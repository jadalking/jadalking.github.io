                    <h2>Hi!</h2>
                    <p>My name is Jada King (she/her pronouns) and I am a third-year 
                    computer science major at Northwestern University. My main interest
                    in the computer science field recently has been education. Growing up
                    in rural West Virginia, I did not have much access to the STEM fields that
                    I was interested in and always wished I could learn more. Now being in college,
                    I love working as a part-time instructor and also as an undergraduate TA so that
                    I can help others get involved with computer science!
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During the summer of 2023, I will be working as a software engineer intern for Gap Inc., which
                    I am extremely excited about! Outside of my studies, I like to spend my free time listening to
                    music and taking photos.
                    </p>
